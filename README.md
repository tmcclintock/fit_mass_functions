# fit_mass_functions
I fit the mass function measured in sims with the tinker_mass_function.

This was created to reduce clutter in the Mass-Function-Emulator repository. When results are generated here, it can be moved by hand over to that repository.

This is a working repository, with very little effort put in to keep the code clean, as it is not meant to be used by other people.
